	You might be asking yourself, what the hell is the Torn? A close friend of mine had created a whole universe called Aurora - The Shattered World. <br>

		Torn (Tor'Ja)</h2>
		<p style=font-style:italic;>“The papers always cover my desk, and they always bring my mother’s words to me, ‘We don’t pray to fix our ancestors' crimes; we must take action to right those wrongs.’ I still hear those words every day when I sit upon this chair and listen to the people. While I wasn't born during the Cataclysm, I work my hardest to fix all things that were broken. I might not be a Geomancer or a Rune Mage and able to move the land together, but I can do my best to fix the wrongs of the people and make them right.” <br>-Judge Tor’Tel<br></p>
		<p>The Torn are a race of people rarely seen without their wrappings. While looking human, there is something that makes them feel as if something is corrupted or wrong about them. This is due to the curse placed on them from birth because of the deeds of their ancestors. Their skin is pale, and their eyes are gray. They are usually wearing wrappings that cover their whole body and only showing their eyes; this goes for both males and females.</p>
		<h3>Hidden Shame</h3>
		<p>It is a closely-held secret and shame that the Torn believe they were the cause of the Shattering. Their priests and magi preach that it is their duty to fix the world and return the goddess Geo from the dead. They are not backed off from magic, and especially necromancy, believing that all magic is a natural part of the universe and the gods’ gifts to their children. Death is considered no barrier but another part of life to them, and many servants and guardians are those who volunteered before dying to continue helping those around them instead of moving onto the afterlife.	</p>
		<h3>Life and Death</h3>
		<p>	They believe in the dual-formed god Nezuem of Life and Death, the ever-flowing cycle of the universe. Many rituals are done in the capital city in his honor and to make amends for the wrongs they have done. Their belief in their part in the Cataclysm has made them sober toward their lives and thus what they consider a sacred duty of trying to put the world back together. Most Torn stay on Tor’Shen, and most of them will make a pilgrimage at some point in their lives to various holy sites.</p>
		<h3>The Torn Conclave</h3>
		<p>The Torn as a race are led by a council on the continent of Tor’Shen. Their capital is Men’Karla, which resides at the center of Tor’Shen, with the only known pure earthen path that bypasses Oceanus in its entirety leading into the Dark Lands.<br><br>The leader of the Torn Council is known simply as the Tor, and the Tor’s second is the Se’Tor. The rest of the council is filled with the three leaders of the different branches of their curses, each of them known as a Tor’Karla. While these five deal with the major problems that face the Torn as a race, each of the three clans have their Tor’Karla that they follow or at least pay some homage to.<br><br>Each of the major families follow a head, known as a Se’Karla, who will lead the family in the manner that they see fit. Generally elders (known as Ja) will help or give advice to the Se’Karla.<br><br>		The three different curses that plague the Torn have caused each to have to adapt to what they can do. The Mages probably had it the easiest, as they can still use their magic to a large degree but have to be careful in how they go about their days. The Breakers spend most of their time working as warriors and miners or doing other jobs for which they can better bend their curse to their will. The Forsaken tend to remain silent but let their writings and actions speak for them, as they try to stay silent in contemplation as they work. <br></p>
		<h3>Daily Life</h3>
		<p>Most children are raised by their families as a whole and not so much by their own parents. Though in recent decades, as they have come in more contact with the rest of the world, this has changed to some degree. The only times the Torn take off their wrappings in front of others is when they are amongst family, showing their pale–almost grayish-toned–skin. <br>		Traditionally, when they awake, they wash their bodies in a small cleansing ritual. Most give a prayer to their own gods (some give prayer to ancestors if they don't have a god they favor) and then go through the process of wrapping themselves. The different branches have different styles of home. Many Mages will find ways to imbue the extra magic in their body to create magic light so as not to put themselves in danger with the elements, and they tend to have many small objects with minor magical embellishments. The Breakers tend to have solid objects and mats that can take on the strength of their curse, more sturdy things to stop them from destroying their homes. The Forsaken tend to have much more somber homes and tend to be silent.<br></p></p>
		<h2>Background Story</h2>
		<p>Jee'Vak grew up in the city of Shar'Letar as an orphan. He had heard his parents were unable to take the burden of having a child, and went elsewhere. He quickly learned to survive only by stealing from merchants. Having been born with the curse of The Forsaken, he failed to make friends through out  the years. After much travail he learned how to deceive others with his words and mitigate his curse. Having been sick of the urchin lifestyle, he and his trusted mouse, <u><em><b>"Speedy"</b></em></u> set out on an adventure of their life. </p>
